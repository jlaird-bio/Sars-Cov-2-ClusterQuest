# Sars-Cov-2-ClusterQuest

We are still trying to understand just how COVID-19 affects the body. Recently, RNA-seq data has become available that might shed light on how it interferes with our molecular machinery. The following script delivers a heatmap of differentially expressed genes in individuals afflicted with COVID-19.

# Goals:

1. Find gene expression data for SARS-Cov-2 and a variety of diseases.

2. Compare SARS-Cov-2 expression data to expression data of each disease using hierarchal clustering.
