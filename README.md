# Sars-Cov-2-ClusterQuest

We are still trying to understand just how COVID-19 affects the body. Recently, RNA-seq data has become available that might shed light on how it interferes with our molecular machinery. Perhaps by comparing this data to gene expression data from other more well characterized disease types, a disease type whose expression pattern is similar could be found. That disease match could have treatments already developed and might prove to be a source of novel treatments for COVID-19.

# Goals:

1. Find gene expression data for SARS-Cov-2 and a variety of diseases.

2. Compare SARS-Cov-2 expression data to expression data of each disease using hierarchal clustering.

3. See if expression patterns match any major disease.
 
4. Possibly compile a list of treatments available for that disease match as novel approaches to treating COVID-19.
