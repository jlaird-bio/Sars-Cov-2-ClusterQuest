# Sars-Cov-2-ClusterQuest

# Goals:

1. Find gene expression data for SARS-Cov-2 and a variety of diseases.

2. Compare SARS-Cov-2 expression data to expression data of each disease.

3. See if expression patterns match any major disease.

4. Possibly compile a list of treatments available for that disease match as novel approaches to treating COVID-19.
